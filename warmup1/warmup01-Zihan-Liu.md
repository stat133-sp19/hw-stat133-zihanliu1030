**Cooking Recipe**
==================

### Ingredients for "Baked Buffalo Wings":

-   1 to 4 pounds chicken wings that have been cut into flats and drumettes
-   1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (using 1 1/2 teaspoons per pound)
-   1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (using 1 teaspoon per pound; use less salt if you’re not using Diamond brand)
-   2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank’s RedHot is traditional) per pound of wings
-   1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter per pound of wings
-   (optional): Homemade Blue Cheese Dressing (below), plus celery and carrot sticks

### “special” kitchen tools:

-   a large baking sheet with foil

### steps:

-   Line a large baking sheet with foil and set an oven-safe cooling rack on top.
-   Pat wings dry with a paper towel, and then, in a large bowl, toss them with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of wings, until thoroughly coated. Arrange them on the rack with some space between them and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours.
-   When you’re ready to bake them, heat your oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of your oven. Bake your wings for 20 minutes, flip them with tongs or a spatula, bake them for another 15 minutes, flip them back over again, and then for 15 final minutes, for a total roasting time of 50 minutes. You might need up to 5 minutes longer for larger wings. Wings are done with they are browned and crisp.
-   While the wings roast, make Buffalo wing sauce. In a medium saucepan, for each pound of wings, combine 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons (for a hotter sauce) to 2 tablespoons (for a mild, more buttery sauce) unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine. Set aside. Make Blue Cheese Dressing, if you wish (recipe below) and prepare carrots and celery.
-   When wings are done, roll each in prepared Buffalo wing sauce. Serve with fixings of your choice. Eat immediately.

### Blue Cheese Dressing:

-   1/3 cup well-shaken buttermilk
-   1/3 cup mayonnaise
-   1/3 cup sour cream
-   Juice of half a lemon
-   2 teaspoons white vinegar
-   1 small garlic clove, minced
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   4 ounces crumbled, firm blue cheese (about 1 cup)
-   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives

-   Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir until combined, but cheese is still lumpy. Season well with salt and pepper. Dressing keeps refrigerated for 5 to 6 days.

**Euclidean Distance**
======================

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>,..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n-space*, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
$$d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q})=d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p})=\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$$
$$=\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean *n-space* is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$\\| \\textbf{p} \\|=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{\\textbf{p}\\cdot\\textbf{p}}$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
